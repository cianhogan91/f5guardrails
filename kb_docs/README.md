# FinCorp Global — Internal Knowledge Base (Demo)

This folder contains approved internal reference documents used by the FinCorp Safe-Chat demo.
These documents are intentionally short and structured to demonstrate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

Key goals:
- Ground answers in internal documentation
- Reduce hallucinations
- Provide auditability when combined with CalypsoAI guardrails

Do not add real customer data, secrets, or production credentials to this demo set.
